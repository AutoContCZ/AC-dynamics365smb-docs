# G/L Account Group â€“ Multi-circuit Accounting 

According to accounting standards, an accounting entity can post transactions within multiple internal accounting areas (Financial, Off-Balance, and Intercompany Accounting).
To set up accounting areas in the system, the G/L Account Group field on the CoA account card is used. The system stops posting when it is posted to financial accounts with different accounting areas in a single accounting transaction.
