# Inventory Counting Documents

At the end of the period, users perform physical inventory counting to reconcile the actual (physical) value of inventory with the one registered in the system. At the end of the counting process, accounting department needs to archive final Inventory Counting Document containing posted values with names of company officials who under liability confirm with their signature that the quantities and amounts stated in the document correspond to ones physically present in company's inventory locations.

For the reasons above, this feature provides the following reports:

- Phys. Inventory List Report is used to print documents from Phys. Inventory Journals (existing report improved).
- Phys. Invt. Counting Document Report is used to print posted Phys. Inventory operations.
