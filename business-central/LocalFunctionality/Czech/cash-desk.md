# Cash Desk Management

The Cash Desks and Cash Documents features allow you to define cash accounts and cash desks for the physical receipt and money withdrawal. Each cash desk must have a separate number series of the cash documents. You can set up separate number series for the receipt cash documents and withdrawal cash documents. The cash desk cases are pre-defined cases to simplify data entry. You can specify individual user authorized to operate with the particular cash desk and transmit cash desks between users.  

The main functionality of the Cash Desk feature is:
- Cash desk setup, cash desk users
- Receipt cash document, withdrawal of cash documents and their posting
- Cash desk cases used as templates for usual accounting transactions
- Payment application with customer and vendor ledger entries
- Payment Application with advance invoices
- Cash desk inventory
- Output documents (receipt cash document, withdrawal cash document)
- Reports - Cash Desk Account Book, Cash Desk Book, Cash Desk Hand Over

The cash desk card contains basic cash register information, such as number, currency, contact details, etc. It also includes billing settings, definitions for checks and limits, and numeric series presets for cash receipts.  

Cash documents are receipt or withdrawal, and can be in different currencies according to the cash register. The documents also enable the releasing, posting and printing of exit documents.  

You can run the apply entries feature from the cash document rows to select customer or vendor entries for alignment. Similarly, features are available for off-setting backup invoices.
