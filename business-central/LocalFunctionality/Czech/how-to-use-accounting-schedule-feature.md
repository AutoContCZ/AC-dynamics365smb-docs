# Account Schedule Feature

As one of the most extensively used features for analysis and reporting, Eastern European countries often ask for the following improvements of the standard Account Schedules feature:

- Common list of expressions – A common list of expressions contains named lines that can be used in formulas of all account schedules. This is done by defining one of the account schedules as a common list of expressions called a Shared Account Schedule.
- Saving results (current state) of analysis – This improvement allows users to store results of analysis done by using account schedules, modification of results, and retrieval of results later on.
- Formulas drill-down – This improvement allows users to drill down on the results of formulas. Drill-down is now accessible for Totalling type formulas. Drilling down on the result of the formula shows the user a new page containing the list of elements used to calculate the results and their description.
- Additional data sources – Apart from being able to perform analysis on GL entries, the user can perform analysis on VAT, customer, vendor, and value entries.
