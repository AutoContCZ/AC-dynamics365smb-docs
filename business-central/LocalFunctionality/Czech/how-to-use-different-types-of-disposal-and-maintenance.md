# Different Types of Disposal and Maintenance

In Czech accounting, it is necessary to post different types of disposal and different types of maintenance of fixed assets to specific G/L accounts. A standard way offers only one method of disposal and maintenance posting.

A new setup is added for this, namely the **FA Extended Posting Group** table. This table allows to set up each FA posting group:

- Posting disposals to different accounts in combination with **Reason Code** field for disposals
- Posting maintenance in combination with the **Maintenance Code** field for maintenance
