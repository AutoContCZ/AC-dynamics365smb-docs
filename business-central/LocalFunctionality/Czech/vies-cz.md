# VIES

The VIES report is used for sales declaration to tax authorities in EU (European Union) countries. According to §102 of VAT Law 235/2004, payers are obliged to submit VIES declaration („Souhrnné hlášení“). The VIES declaration has to be submitted to the tax authorities electronically.
The VIES functionality allows you to:

- Set up state reporting
