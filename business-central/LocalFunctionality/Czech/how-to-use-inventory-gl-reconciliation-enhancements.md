# Inventory – G/L Reconciliation Enhancements

Since the Czech localized application contains modifications in the inventory posting (special Account for rounding functionalities and special intermediate WIP accounts), this must also be included in the **Inventory – G/L Reconciliation** matrix form.  
These modifications have been introduced to the interface and the calculation procedures have been modified.
