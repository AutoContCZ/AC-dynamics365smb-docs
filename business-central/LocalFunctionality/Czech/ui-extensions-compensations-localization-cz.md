# Compensation Localization for Czech (Extension)

The Compensation solution helps companies for offsetting receivables and payables. Compensations are used when the company's customer is also its supplier. Entries to be counted can be entered manually or automatically from the Compensation Card. In addition, there are functions to mark entries to count and recalculating the balance. There is also a print-out of the Agreement on Mutual Settlement of Receivables and Payables under Czech legislation.
