# WIP Extended Posting

The Czech legal Work in Progress (WIP) posting scheme includes the following new general ledger accounts:
- Consumption Account
- Change in Inventory of WIP Account
- Change in Inventory of Product Account  

This feature allows you to correctly perform Czech WIP and production posting. It is therefore possible to set up a combination of location and inventory posting group for the accounts Consumption, Work in Progress, Change of Semi-finished Product, Change of Product.

This new posting scheme is used in the following transactions:
- Consumption posting in the consumption journal
- Posting the costs of capacities in the output journal
- Finishing orders and automatic production reporting
