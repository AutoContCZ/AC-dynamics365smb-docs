# Inventory – G/L Reconciliation Enhancements
According to the Czech specific requirements, the Inventory – G/L Reconciliation matrix form must into account take the Czech specific inventory posting Accounts: Inventory Rounding Account and Intermediate WIP Account. Since the Czech localized application contains modifications in the inventory posting, special Account for rounding functionalities, and special intermediate WIP accounts, must also be included in the Inventory – G/L Reconciliation matrix form.

These modifications have been introduced to the interface and the calculation procedures have been modified.
