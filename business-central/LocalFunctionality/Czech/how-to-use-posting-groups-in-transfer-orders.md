# Posting Groups in Transfer Orders
Czech posting rules require location transfers to be posted with the defined Inventory Adjmt. Account different from other item Journal postings.
In the Transfer Orders functionality, fields for Gen. Bus. Post. Groups for Ship and Receive posting were added. This feature enables you to post different transfer orders with different General Posting Setup and also different from postings in item Journal.

In Transfer Route, fields for Gen. Bus. Post. Groups for Ship and Receive posting were added. This setup is automatically copied to transfer the order based on the used transfer route.
